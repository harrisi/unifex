# Creating Unifex Natives

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Unifex natives to write native code that can be compiled both as NIF and CNode.

## Preparation

In order to start working, you need to prepare a few things:

1. First, you have to add unifex to your dependencies as well as unifex and bundlex compilers.
   Please refer to [Installation](https://hexdocs.pm/unifex/readme.html#installation) section to see how to do it. 
2. After successful installation we should take a look at [Bundlex](https://github.com/membraneframework/bundlex).
   Unifex uses Bundlex to compile the native code. 
   You can think of Bundlex as a tool that generates build scripts responsible for including proper libs compiling your native code and linking it with mentioned libs.
   To make it work, create the `bundlex.exs` file in the project's root directory with the following content:
```elixir
defmodule Example.BundlexProject do
  use Bundlex.Project

  def project() do
    [
      natives: natives(Bundlex.platform())
    ]
  end

  def natives(_platform) do
    [
      example: [
        sources: ["example.c"],
        interface: [:nif, :cnode],
        preprocessor: Unifex
      ]
    ]
  end
end
```

   This defines a native called `example`, that should be implemented in the `example.c` file. We'll also need `example.spec.exs` file, that Unifex needs to generate boilerplate code for compiling the native as NIF and CNode. Both files should be located in the `c_src/example` folder. Setting `Unifex` as a preprocessor lets it extend the configuration with the generated code.
   More details on how to use bundlex can be found in its [documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/bundlex).

## Native code

Let's start by creating a `c_src/example` directory, and the files that will be needed:

```bash
mkdir -p c_src/example
cd c_src/example
touch example.c
touch example.h
touch example.spec.exs
```

Here are the contents of `example.spec.exs`:

```elixir
module Example

interface [NIF, CNode]

spec foo(num :: int) :: {:ok :: label, answer :: int}
```

Note that here we also specified an interface or even interfaces!
It is not necessary because if we didn't do it Unifex would take it from `bundlex.exs`.
However, this is a good practice that makes code clearer and is also a little faster than fetching info from `bundlex.exs.` 

Next step is to implement our `example.h`.
Since our example is very simple our `example.h` will be very simple too:
```c
#include "_generated/example.h"
```

It just includes generated header file that contains some function definitions we use in our `example.c`. The header will be generated by Unifex based on the `example.spec.exs` file.

Now, let's provide required implementation in `example.c`:

```c
#include "example.h"

UNIFEX_TERM foo(UnifexEnv* env, int num) {
  return foo_result_ok(env, num);
}
```
The provided `foo` implementation returns the passed argument, by using `foo_result_ok`. For every tuple, that might be returned from our Unifex function, there will be generated implementation of result function named `[orginal_function_name]_result_[label]`, where `label` is an atom with type `label` in returned tuple. The type of the first argument of this function will be `UnifexEnv*`, number and types of the rest of the arguments will depend on the number and types of rest of elements in the returned tuple

At this moment the project should successfully compile. 
Run `mix deps.get && mix compile` to make sure everything is fine.
In `c_src/_generated/` directory there should appear files both for usage as NIF and CNode.

### Types
With Unifex, you can use some of built-in Elixir types (see more in [documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/unifex/supported_types.html)), as well as your custom types. Currently, we support defining enums and structs. If you want to add structs or enums to the API of your native functions, you have to define them in the `*.spec.exs` file. There is an example of this:

```elixir
type my_enum :: :option_one | :option_two | :option_three | :option_four | :option_five

type my_struct :: %My.Struct{
  id: int,
  data: [int],
  name: string
}

type nested_struct :: %Nested.Struct{
  inner_struct: my_struct,
  id: int
}
```

Then, we will generate two versions of native declarations of our custom types, each for `C` and `C++`. An example of version for `C` is posted below

```cpp
enum MyEnum_t {
  MY_ENUM_OPTION_ONE,
  MY_ENUM_OPTION_TWO,
  MY_ENUM_OPTION_THREE,
  MY_ENUM_OPTION_FOUR,
  MY_ENUM_OPTION_FIVE
};
typedef enum MyEnum_t MyEnum;

struct my_struct_t {
  int id;
  int *data;
  unsigned int data_length;
  char *name;
};
typedef struct my_struct_t my_struct;

struct nested_struct_t {
  my_struct inner_struct;
  int id;
};
typedef struct nested_struct_t nested_struct;
```

The name of enum will be translated to PascalCase, specific options will be prefixed with enum name and translated to MACRO_CASE.

Remember, that in `C` it is forbidden to make a cyclic chain of containment in the way, that it was made above.

Now, you can use your custom types, like basic ones, e.g.

```elixir
spec example_function(in_enum :: my_enum, in_struct :: nested_struct) :: {:ok :: label, out_struct :: my_struct} | {:error :: label, reason :: atom}
```

```cpp
UNIFEX_TERM example_function(UnifexEnv *env, MyEnum in_enum, nested_struct in_struct) {
  if (in_enum == MY_ENUM_OPTION_ONE) {
    return example_function_result_error(env, "failed");
  }
  return example_function_result_ok(env, in_struct.inner_struct);
}
```

If you want to pass enum to Unifex function on Elixir side, you have to use atom (this same, that was used in enum definition in `*.spec.exs` file). By analogy, the result of Unifex function returning enum will be visible as an atom on the Elixir side. What is important, declaration of a specific struct in `*.spec.exs` will not automatically make it available in your Elixir code - you are responsible for providing struct module on your own.
## Running code

### NIF

All you have to do in order to access natively implemented functions is to create a module with the name as defined 
in `example.spec.exs` and to use `Unifex.Loader` there:

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  use Unifex.Loader
end
```

And that's it! You can now run `iex -S mix` and check it out yourself:

```elixir
iex(1)> Example.foo(10)
{:ok, 10}
```

### CNode
In case of `CNodes`, module with `Unifex.Loader` is unnecessary. We would just do:
```elixir
iex(2)> require Unifex.CNode
Unifex.CNode
iex(3)> {:ok, cnode} = Unifex.CNode.start_link(:example)
{:ok,
 %Unifex.CNode{
   bundlex_cnode: %Bundlex.CNode{
     node: :"bundlex_cnode_0_4eb957f2-fd47-47c2-b816-6e9c580e658a@michal",
     server: #PID<0.259.0>
   },
   node: :"bundlex_cnode_0_4eb957f2-fd47-47c2-b816-6e9c580e658a@michal",
   server: #PID<0.259.0>
 }}
iex(bundlex_app_4eb957f2-...)4> Unifex.CNode.call(cnode, :foo, [10])
{:ok, 10}
```
